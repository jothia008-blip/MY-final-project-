Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic violation and citation data using Python to understand patterns, trends, and insights that help in decision-making and enforcement planning.

The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python libraries in Google Colab.

 Objectives

Analyze traffic violation patterns

Identify top violation types

Study citation status and fine amounts

Understand agency and district-wise trends

Extract meaningful business and social insights

Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

Pandas – Data processing

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical visualization

NumPy – Numerical operations

 Types of Analysis Used

Descriptive Analysis – What happened in the data

Diagnostic Analysis – Why it happened

Predictive Analysis – What may happen next

Prescriptive Analysis – What actions can be taken

 Key Insights

Certain violations occur more frequently than others

Some districts and agencies show higher citation rates

Fine amounts vary significantly by violation type

Payment patterns show gaps between paid and pending balances

High-risk areas can be identified for better enforcement

 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to convert raw traffic data into meaningful insights through analysis and visualization.
It helps authorities and organizations understand violation behavior, improve planning, and support better decision-making.
